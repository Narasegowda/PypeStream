# TILEDESK REST API

## Introduction

Tiledesk is a live chat solution that helps businesses increase sales conversion by engaging important leads on their websites. It is our goal to help many of these businesses use the Tiledesk API (the "API") to automate and enhance their customer support with Tiledesk.

## The API
This is the documentation for the Tiledesk REST API. Read the contents of this page carefully to understand how to be a good API citizen.

Endpoints are documented with the HTTP method for the request and a partial resource identifier. Example:

GET /v1/

Prepend https://api.tiledesk.com to the resource identifier to get the full endpoint URL:

https://api.tiledesk.com/v1/

The examples in the docs are cURL statements. You can run the statements on a command line to try out different API requests. In Windows, you'll need to modify some of the examples in the docs to make them work.

## Security and Authentication
This API is an SSL-only API, regardless of how you may have your account configured. You must be a Tiledesk user to make API requests.


### Basic authentication

Use the following authentication format with your email address and password:

{email_address}:{password}

#### Example

```
curl -v -X GET -u andrea.leo@f21.it:123456 https://api.tiledesk.com/v1/5ab0f32757066e0014bfd718/departments
```


### JWT authentication

Use the following authentication format with a JWT token.


### Get a JWT Token

Use the signin method to get a valid JWT token:

#### Example
```
curl -v -X POST -d 'email=andrea.leo@f21.it&password=123456' https://api.tiledesk.com/v1/auth/signin
```

#### Example

```
curl -v -X GET -H 'Authorization: JWT <JWT_TOKEN>' https://api.tiledesk.com/v1/5ab0f32757066e0014bfd718/departments
```


#### Rate Limiting
This API is rate limited. We only allow a certain number of requests per minute. We reserve the right to adjust the rate limit for given endpoints in order to provide a high quality of service for all clients. As an API consumer, you should expect to be able to make at least 200 requests per minute.

If the rate limit is exceeded, Tiledesk will respond with a HTTP 429 Too Many Requests response code and a body that details the reason for the rate limiter kicking in.

#### Request Format
This is a JSON-only API. You must supply a Content-Type: application/json header on PUT and POST requests. Sometimes you have to set an Accept: application/json header on a specific request. You may get a text/plain response in case of an error such as a bad request. You should treat this as an error you need to take action on.

#### Response Format
Tiledesk responds to successful requests with HTTP status codes in the 200 or 300 range. 
When you create or update a resource, Tiledesk renders the resulting JSON representation in the response body.
Time stamps use UTC time and their format is ISO8601.
We respond to unsuccessful requests with HTTP status codes in the 400 range. The response may be "text/plain" content type for API level error messages (such as when trying to call the API without SSL). If you see a response from a known endpoint that looks like plain text, you probably made a syntax error in your REST call. If you ever experience responses with status codes in the 500 range, Tiledesk may be experiencing internal issues or having a scheduled maintenance (during which we send a 503 Service Unavailable status code). Please check the status page in such cases for any known issues.

When building an API client, we recommend treating any 500 status codes as a warning or temporary state. However, if the status persists and we don't have a publicly announced maintenance or service disruption, contact us at info@frontiere21.it
